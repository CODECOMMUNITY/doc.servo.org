                <h2>Search Tricks</h2>

                <p>
                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code> or <code>* -> vec</code>)
                </p>
